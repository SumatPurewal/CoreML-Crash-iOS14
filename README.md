# CoreML-Crash-iOS14
Code to reproduce crash on a simple CoreML model in iOS14. *crash requires iPhone11 or newer.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Build and run the project on an iPhone Xs (it will succeed).
2. Build and run the project on an iPhone 11, iPhone 11 pro or similar (it will crash with an out of memory error). I tested on an iPhone 12 pro max and it worked without issues. Seems to be restricted to devices released in 2019?
